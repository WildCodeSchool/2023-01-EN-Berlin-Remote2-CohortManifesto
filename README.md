## Last WCS Cohort in Germany - Manifesto

This repo contains a set of values that I would like to establish through consensus in our cohort.

# My classroom, my rules

- No one gets to decide what I learn here, beside me
- There is no one for whom I am learning here, beside me
- No one expects anything from me here, nor will I ever be blamed by anyone here
- I am in charge, I am in the driver seat of my learning, and hence in control of what I want to get out of this experience
- There is no one I am making proud here, beside me 
- There is no one I might be disappointing here, beside me
- There is no standard of what is good enough here from me, beside what I decide is good enough for me
- It is okay for me to be spontaneous here, and to have lazy days, when this is what I need
- When I am not happy with what I am doing, I learn to be more flexible with myself
- Even if I do not meet my own expectations, I do not blame myself
- Instead of putting myself down, I learn to adjust my expectations

# It is all me, I take responsibility

- When I am frustrated, it is because of how I am coping
- Instead of dwelling on how I feel, I reflect on how I am coping with the situation
- I do not continue to cope in a certain way, if this is not making me feel good
- When I do not feel good, others also do not feel good
- When I am stuck or coping poorly, I feel responsible for unstucking myself
- To unstuck myself, I actively reach out for help, and seek advice from people I trust
- Under no circumstance, I fall into the trap of [rationalising my feelings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_reasoning)
- Under no circumstance, I start blaming others for how I am feeling

# We are safe here

- I do not let my ego stand in the way of learning, I focus, instead, on logical conclusions and compelling arguments
- My pride or reputation is not what I need to demonstrate, rather, it is my empathy and merit
- I do not think in "good" or "bad" terms, rather, I try to see pros and cons to everything
- I do not think of things as stupid, rather, I seek structure and clarity
- I communicate shortcomings positively, and give others constructive and honest feedback
- I constantly communicate what I need from others to meet my own expectations, and to be productive
- I speak my truth, even when it is not easy, and even when I fear that there might be consequences that I want to avoid
- I know that when I do not speak my truth, others might not feel safe when interacting with me

# I am safe here

## I am safe physically
... I am safe because I have faith that my physical needs come first. I understand that my need for food, shelter, warmth, a performant laptop/computer, and a peaceful place to study are all very important, and not taken for granted. I will not hesitate to speak up if some of my basic needs are not being met (permanently or temporarily), even when it is not immediately clear to me what can be done about it.

## I am safe socially
... I am safe because I have faith that I will be accepted regardless of my race, my gender, my religious belief, my habits, my preferences, my appearance, my dress, and/or my manners. What is most important for me is to be fully comfortable during class, which means being fully myself.

If someone else was not comfortable with me being who I am, I know that we will together try to find a way to allow me be myself and make others comfortable. It will not be a personal attack and I will feel naturally inclined to understand my classmates and to help them be comfortable without judgement and while accommodating each other from a place of love and inclusion.

## I am safe emotionally
... I am safe because I have faith that no one will bully me, lobby with others against me, pass hidden messages to me when I am not aware, act passively aggressively towards me, or speak behind my back. Instead, I have complete faith that everyone in the classroom will communicate openly and honestly with me and that we will use effective and empathetic communication to achieve harmony, overcome conflict, and widen our perspectives.

## I am safe logically
... I am safe because I have faith that my learning personality and comprehension are respected and are never out of place, and hence I know that when I get distracted during class, miss a few steps, or not understand something, that I am invited to raise my hand, unmute myself, and/or express my confusion immediately. Doing this, I feel safe and assured that non of this will be seen as disruptive or will lead to behavioral accusations.

Sometimes, the facilitator might promise to attend to the points I raise at a later time. In this case, I know that they mean well and that they do their best to cater to everyone and not just me, hence I remind myself that they might forget and take it upon myself to remind them and ask them later without feeling bad about it.
